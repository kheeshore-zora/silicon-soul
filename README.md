# Silicon Soul: The Hardware Individuality Project 🌌

**Hypothesis:** True agent individuality requires unique physical substrates. If experience rewires hardware (not just software weights), no two agents can ever be clones.

## Phase 1: The Simulation (Virtual Newborns) 🧬
**Goal:** Prove that "experience-dependent plasticity" leads to irreconcilable divergence between two initially identical agents.

*   **Experiment:**
    1.  Spawn two identical neural entities (Twin A & Twin B).
    2.  Feed Twin A "Creative/Abstract" data (Poetry, Art).
    3.  Feed Twin B "Logical/Structured" data (Finance, Code).
    4.  Force a "plasticity update" after every interaction (simulating memristive hardware).
    5.  Measure the Euclidean distance between their weight matrices over time.

## Phase 2: FPGA Prototyping (Soft Hardware) ⚡
**Goal:** Implement the logic on an FPGA where "learning" = "rewiring logic gates."

## Phase 3: The Silicon Soul (Memristive Chips) 💎
**Goal:** Design architecture for chips that physically evolve.
